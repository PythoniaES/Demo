## Download data

It is very important not to forget to download the data before running the *main.py*, as otherwise we will not be able to choose any exchanges to label.

The data will be downloaded from Binance, to do this we simply need to run the file *data_downloader.py*.
Before running it he needs to insert our *api_key* and *api_secret*

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
